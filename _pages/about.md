My passion for data analysis and visualization was sparked by the book [*Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness). The author presented numerous simple yet elegant charts to demonstrate the incredible transformations that have taken place worldwide in the past two centuries.

I saw the beauty of data and realized that different people would interpret the same data in different ways. With my adept analytical abilities and inquisitive nature, I am confident that I can narrate my own story in the near future.
