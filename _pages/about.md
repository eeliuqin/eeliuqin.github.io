For the past 5 years, as a full-stack developer, I've been working on building e-commerce websites. My interest in data analysis and data visualization began with the book [*Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness), where the author used many simple and yet elegant charts to show the amazing changes that have occurred in the world over the past two hundred years. I saw the beauty of data, but I also wondered if different people would tell different stories with the same data.

I believe that with my solid analytical skills and strong curiosity, I can tell my own story in the near future.
