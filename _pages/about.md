Hi, I'm Qin Liu ðŸ‘‹

### Thanks for stopping by. Here's a little bit about myself...

As a Data Analyst with a background in Software Development, I have developed a passion for data analysis and visualization. This passion was ignited by the book [*Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness), which showcased the power of simple yet elegant charts in demonstrating the incredible transformations that have taken place worldwide in the past two centuries.

Through this experience, I learned to appreciate the beauty in data and the diverse interpretations that can be derived from it. This realization inspired me to consider how to communicate my own story through data. I believe that continuous learning is crucial to staying ahead in this field.

Over the past year, I have completed various online courses and achieved certifications to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies:

- Biostatistics in Public Health by Johns Hopkins University (2023, Coursera)
- Health Information Literacy for Data Analytics by University of California, Davis (2023, Coursera)
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (2022, AWS)
- Tableau Desktop Specialist (2022, Tableau)
- Machine Learning by Stanford University & DeepLearning.AI (2022, Coursera)
- Google Data Analytics (2022, Coursera)

The list of skills and accomplishments I have acquired is still growing. My journey has just begun.
